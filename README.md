### General Helper Notes
**1. Setting up *Anaconda* on Ubuntu/Linux** [[PDF](PDFs/Setting-up%20Anaconda%20for%20Ubuntu_Linux.pdf)]


**2. Working with *Jupyter Notebook***

Notebook is a creative way of presenting your project outputs as it allows users to create documents (notebook) that contains codes, equations, and other visualizations all in one place.

  - Activate your working environment
  - Install ipykernel: `pip install ipykernel`
  - Adding virtual environment to jupyter: `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<env_name>`
  - Run notebook: `jupyter notebook`

**3. Creating your *Hugging Face Space*** [[PDF](PDFs/HuggingFace_Spaces.pdf)]

**4. Using *Google Colab***

All python scripts should be on your Google Drive where your Notebooks are mounted.
